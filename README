Varnish Accept-Language VCL
===========================

Here you will find a VCL config file for Varnish (http://varnish-cache.org)
This VCL allows you to normalize and filter all the incoming requests
Accept-Language headers and reduce them to just the languages your site supports.

*** WARNING ***
This VCL consists of C code. Your Varnish might explode. YMMV.
Don't use it in production if you don't know what you're doing.
We are using it in production, but we _don't_ know what we're doing :).

Why would you want this?
------------------------
Your site supports English and Japanese languages.
Your client browsers will send every possible Accept-Language header on Earth.
If you enable "Vary: Accept-Language" on Varnish or on your backends,
the cache hit ratio will rapidly drop, because of the huge variations
in Accept-Language contents.

With this VCL, the Accept-Language header will be "rewritten" to just
"en" or "ja", depending on your client settings. If no match occurs,
you can select a default language.

The rewritten header is "X-Varnish-Accept-Language".
You can choose to put this header back in "Accept-Language" if you wish.
In this way, the normalization will be completely transparent.

Requirements
------------

- gcc, make
- a recent perl, with `prove'

Instructions
-------------

1) Configure the list of languages your site supports
   and the default fallback in the Makefile, *NOT* in the C code.

2) Run 'make && make test'
   You should see "All tests successful" at the end of the execution

3) Install the generated accept-language.vcl in /etc/varnish/

4) At the top of your main VCL file, add the following line:

     include "/etc/varnish/accept-language.vcl"

   and then in your vcl_recv() add:

     vcl_rewrite_accept_language();

   This will parse Accept-Language and insert the final language into the
   "X-Varnish-Accept-Language" header (req.http.X-Varnish-Accept-Language).

   or optionally specifying a custom header name. You need the length of
   the string in octal before it, and a colon (":") after. Example:

     vcl_rewrite_accept_language("\007X-Lang:");

6) Restart Varnish

7) Cross your fingers

8) Profit !!
